Whether you are an advanced web developer or a beginner looking to learn CakePHP, this book promises to help you build simple and complex web sites, quickly and easily. The goal of this book is to provide a wide variety of useful functionality that is required by most websites today. In the final chapter, we will take all that we’ve learned and create one final large project. During this process, I will instill my knowledge in taking a project from start to finish including creating a scope of work to ensure we have accomplished our target goals. By the end of this book, you should be able to build fully functional websites using CakePHP. Hopefully, you should also be able to cut your development time at least in half, if not more!",
